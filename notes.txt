Here are a few areas that could be evaluated in the code:

Error handling: There is some error handling in the code, but it could be improved. For example,
if the transcription fails, the program just prints "Transcription failed" to the console.
It would be better to provide more information about what went wrong and how to fix it.

Magic strings: There are a few magic strings in the code that could be extracted into constants or
variables with descriptive names. For example, "us-east-2" and "input.wav" are both used multiple times in the code.

Scalability: The current implementation of the code is designed to run on a single machine. If the
program needs to handle a large number of requests, it might be necessary to distribute the workload across
 multiple machines or use a more scalable infrastructure.

User interface: The current implementation of the user interface is fairly basic. It might be worth exploring
other ways to interact with the program, such as through a web interface or a chatbot.

Security: The program currently stores the GPT-3 API key in plaintext in the code. This is not secure and could be
exploited if the code is ever compromised. It would be better to store the API key in an environment variable or some
other secure location.


document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
  var submitButton = document.querySelector("#submit_button");
  submitButton.addEventListener("click", function() {
    var inputValue = document.querySelector("#input_value").value;
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open("POST", "/process");
    xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
    xhr.onload = function() {
      if (xhr.status === 200) {
        var response = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
        var outputValue = response.output_value;
        document.querySelector("#output_value").textContent = outputValue;
        console.log("Data returned successfully");
      } else {
        console.log("Request failed with status: " + xhr.status);
      }
    };
    xhr.onerror = function() {
      console.log("Error in making the request");
    };
    xhr.onabort = function() {
      console.log("Request was aborted");
    };
    xhr.onloadend = function() {
      console.log("Request completed");
    };
    xhr.send(JSON.stringify({input_value: inputValue}));
  });
});
